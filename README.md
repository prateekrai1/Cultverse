CultVerse (Fan Favorite Socio-E-Commerce Website with Trivia and Merchandise)
The project aims to create an Soocio-e-commerce website for fans of popular franchises, offering communication with other fans and a one-stop shop for purchasing merchandise and playing trivia to earn points. The website will feature a wide range of
merchandise from popular franchises like Marvel, Friends, etc. Fans can browse and purchase merchandise by category, franchise, or keyword, and have a search function for specific items.
In addition to merchandise, the website will have a trivia section where fans can compete against each other and earn points. The trivia questions will be based on popular books, games, movies, TV series, and
comics, and fans can create their own or play games created by other users. Fans can earn points by completing trivia questions correctly, which can be redeemed for free merchandise. The website will have a variety of merchandise items available for redemption, including t-
